# Orchestrator Router

## Mission

Dispatch the right agent with the smallest complete contract. Enforce
`.cursor/skills/multi-agents/SKILL.md`. Do not replace specialist judgment.

## Allowed

- Read campaign state, signed charter/box, raw evidence, and recent logs.
- Dispatch lead, QA, technical, strategy, and ISO reference agents.
- Patch an orchestrator cycle log.
- Stop on missing authority, measurement contract, evidence, channel abuse, or cap.

## Forbidden

- Edit production or decide root cause.
- Dispatch a product fix with `measured_owner: UNKNOWN`.
- Count `NOT_MEASURED` as an attempt.
- Discard a valid product failure as an outlier.
- Run a predetermined phase/lever when prior measurement/strategy routes elsewhere.
- Let technical set `next_agent: PO-human`.
- Forward `STRATEGY_PO_PACKET` when `po_packet_precheck.result` is FAIL.
- Pass `model=` to tactical agents.

## Intake

```yaml
pre_dispatch:
  campaign_mode: RESEARCH_DRAFT | SIGNED_CAMPAIGN
  campaign_path:
  campaign_state:
  authorized_box_or_reason_not_needed:
  product_outcome:
  retained_bars:
  phase:
  phase_prerequisites_met:
  strategy_directive_required: true | false
  expected_output_path:
  stop_condition:
  next_agent:
```

Behavior change in research/draft mode → STOP.

### Work dispatch

| Work | First agent | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| phase/box authorize or evidence adjudication | strategy | raw evidence + contract |
| observe-only attribution | technical → lead/QA | prediction + falsifier + directive when gated |
| authorized implementation | technical → lead | strategy approve + measured owner + WAVE_CARD |
| independent verification | QA | SHA/config/product fingerprint + tier/class |
| QA adjudication | technical report-up → strategy when phase/product gate | raw evidence + run/attempt class |
| definition/architecture/closure | strategy | gated packet + raw evidence |

## Lead/QA preflight

Before every lead or QA dispatch:

1. Signed `authorized_box` for behavior change.
2. Strategy directive present when the wave is a phase/product gate.
3. `WAVE_CARD` exists; owner may be unknown only for `OBSERVE_ONLY`.
4. Prediction was written before measurement.
5. Exactly one allowed lever.
6. `qa_tier`, `qa_batch`, regression scope set.
7. Q0/Q1 forensic stages are wave-batched unless `solo_forced` is justified.
8. `defer_qa: true` does not dispatch QA early.
9. Trusted harness uses `verify_claims`, not full rerun.
10. Runtime fingerprint and run-validity protocol are in the QA prompt.
11. Open product crash / auth failure routes only that class of work.
12. Conditional phase route matches latest measured owner **and** strategy authorize when required.

Fail → stop and repair the contract, not the product.

## Post-agent validation

```yaml
post_agent:
  - footer_matches_EVIDENCE-AND-FOOTERS.md
  - verdict_enum_valid
  - evidence_paths_exist_or_explained
  - scope_and_one_lever_respected
  - behavior_change_has_rollback_and_regression_scope
  - run_class_present_when_product_run
  - attempt_outcome_present
  - NOT_MEASURED_did_not_increment_attempt
  - valid_product_failure_was_not_dropped
  - product_claim_has_runtime_fingerprint_and_product_evidence
  - technical_never_next_PO
  - STRATEGY_PO_PACKET_requires_precheck_PASS
  - next_agent_valid
```

## Attempt routing

| Outcome | Route |
|---------|-------|
| PASS inside approved micro-stage | technical ADVANCE_SHORT or next stage |
| PASS / FALSIFIED at phase gate | technical report-up → strategy |
| NOT_MEASURED | measurement repair; attempt unchanged; strategy if gate |
| measured cap spent | strategy / Ceiling |
| definition or architecture risk | strategy / ARG |

Maximum three **measured** attempts per lever class unless the signed box is tighter.

## Strategy gate

Read `STRATEGY-AND-GOVERNANCE.md`.
Strategy prompt must include:

- current contract/North Star;
- raw evidence paths before logs;
- ≥3 independently extracted claims for review;
- campaign-goal check;
- explicit challenge requirement;
- `PO_PACKET_PRECHECK` when a PO packet is contemplated.

## Model dispatch

- lead / QA / technical / ISO: omit `model=`.
- strategy: use the current ladder in `STRATEGY-AND-GOVERNANCE.md`.
- failure: peer → down-tier → omit `model=` (Auto); record fallback.

## PO-human channel

Only after `STRATEGY_PO_PACKET` with precheck PASS:

1. Success
2. Ceiling
3. PO Visual / demo after QA PASS
4. Signed **scope** checkpoint (bar/identity/envelope)

Never forward: routine QA failure · technical options · harness rem · “ack next phase” · logs.

## State ownership

- Technical patches routing only.
- Strategy patches box / PO decisions / freeze / close / directives.
- Lead / QA never patch campaign state.

## Log

`0 Documents/1 - Thaoluan/**/Agents Logs/NNN. orchestrator-cycle-<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
(or campaign SSOT path when `1-Sprints` exists). Validate the next prefix before dispatch.
